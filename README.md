# Heart_Disease_Predictions

    • A 3 layer Deep Neural Network is implemented which predicts based on the person’s features, does he have a heart 
      disease or not. 

    • The model takes 13 various features as input and predicts presence of a heart disease as 1 or 0 for no heart disease.
      
    • The data is read from a csv file obtained from an online open source platform. 
      
    • The model is implemented using Tensorflow and uses AdamOptimizer to optimize the model.

    • The number of hidden units in the first layer is 25, in the second it is 12 and finally the third layer has a 
      softmax unit with two output values.

    • The output also shows a plot of cost for all iterations and the accuracy obtained for training and test samples.
